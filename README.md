# 𓆤DBay 𓁛Mirage


DBay plugin to mirror, parse and process text files (HTML, CSV, ...) in SQL

This module has been pulled from [a preliminary version in
`dbay-rustybuzz`](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/dbay-rustybuzz)

🚧 Work in progress 🚧

## To Do

* table `mrg_datasources`
  * **[–]** there might be datasources we do want to import data from *without* mirroring them, so there
    should be a flag for that.
  * **[–]** there may be direct input or results of HTTP queries &cpp so better use URLs instead of file
    system paths
