# dbay-mirage


DBay plugin to mirror, parse and process text files (HTML, CSV, ...) in SQL





## To Do

* table `mrg_datasources`
  * **[–]** there might be datasources we do want to import data from *without* mirroring them, so there
    should be a flag for that.
  * **[–]** there may be direct input or results of HTTP queries &cpp so better use URLs instead of file
    system paths
